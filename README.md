Project Description
A decentralized medical record management system built on blockchain technology that ensures secure, transparent, and patient-controlled healthcare data storage. This system enables patients to maintain ownership of their medical records while allowing authorized healthcare providers to access and update patient information securely.
The platform leverages smart contracts to manage access permissions, ensuring that only authorized medical professionals can view or modify patient records based on explicit patient consent.
